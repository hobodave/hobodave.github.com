I am a 29 year old web developer (PHP/Javascript/Rails) for a healthcare organization in Chicago, IL.

I was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up there, and the surrounding suburbs in Virginia. I am a Computer Science
graduate of Virginia Tech. I've been programming and tinkering with computers since I was 5, starting with  [Logo][1]
on an Apple II. Since then I've reached a fair level of proficiency in C, Ruby, Java, Javascript, and most 
recently PHP.
