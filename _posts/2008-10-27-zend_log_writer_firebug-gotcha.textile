A few weeks ago I found a gem of a class called "Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug":http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.log.writers.html#zend.log.writers.firebug within "Zend Framework":http://framework.zend.com/. It really is a *must have* when it comes to debug logging.

However, a few weeks ago something bizarre happened that caused all of my "FirePHP":http://www.firephp.org/ logging to break. I scoured the web for bug reports to find issues _similar_ but not quite the same. I wasn't using AJAX calls, I could see the "FirePHP":http://www.firephp.org/ headers in the response headers of FireBug, but I couldn't see the formatted output.

I finally got fed up today. I hate var_dump's and wanted my FirePHP logging back. After a near flying knee to my computer screen, I figured it out.

It appears that I was using FirePHP v0.1.2, and the latest was 0.2. For reasons beyond my knowledge, "Firefox":http://getfirefox.com/ wasn't detecting this as needing an upgrade.

After upgrading to 0.2 my FirePHP log messages worked again! I hope this shaves a few days of someone's frustrations.
