title: PhpGhettoDoc - Document your PHP w/ ruby?
---
In a moment of boredom I decided I needed a simple way to document a giant batch of PHP files with skeleton PhpDocblocks. PHP not being my first language, I decided why not do it in ruby. I find ruby scripting to be quick, fast enough, and it has lots of great easy to use modules (e.g., "Find":http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Find.html).

That said here she is:
<script src="http://gist.github.com/100412.js"></script>
